"EFFECTIVE LOW-COST TIME-DOMAIN AUDIO SEPARATION USING GLOBALLY ATTENTIVE LOCALLY RECURRENT NETWORKS"
paper link:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05014v1.pdf

tasnet is the basic of recent speech separation!
convtasnet is also a good job!
Today GALR is similar to DPRNN,DPTnet,perhaps all of them are good at long term modeling
but i recommend the sudoRMRF!

i am not the author of this paper,so there are some defects in GALR.py
first,the poistion encoding
second,the dimension is little bit different from paper

if there are some errors,please contact me !
thanks the former contributors had been mentioned in GALR.py
